## Overview

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) version of the Loophole Landing Page from Frontend Mentor.

Dynamic Content Loading: The <main> area loads HTML snippets for each page (home, about, careers, events, products, support).

SPA Routing: Navigation is handled client-side via the navigate() function.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JavaScript modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API
- Client-side SPA routing (vanilla JavaScript)

### What I learned

Simple SPA routing and JavaScript module handling.

### Continued development

In the future, I will focus more on SPA routing and on building my sites using JavaScript modules.
